## Building
### Building with Maven
To build the project with Maven we offer the following profiles
* server : ` mvn package -Pserver `
* client : ` mvn package -Pclient `

For a faster build you can skip the unit tests activating also the profile `-Pnotest `

The output directory for the jars is set to [/deliveries/final/jar](/deliveries/final/jar)

### Using provided jars

If you want you can use the jars we already built for you, you can find them [here](/deliveries/final/jar)


## Server

### Use our server
We created for you a server you can use to play [santorini40.xyz](http://santorini40.xyz)
Our default port is 1234

You can check the [logger](http://santorini40.xyz) to see the server status any time

### Run your server
If you want to run the server on your machine you can use the following command, this is the easiest way to run it
```bash
java -jar server.jar
```
If your're planning to run the server jar on a real server, please edit the [service.sh](/deliveries/final/jar/service.sh) script, editing the following paths and port: 
```bash
PATH_TO_JAR=/path/to/server.jar
PATH_TO_LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log
PID_PATH_NAME=/path/to/pid-file
PORT=xxxx
```
Don't forget to `chmod +x ./service.sh` and then you can start, stop and restart the server using the following command which automatically creates a new thread, and ignores the HUP
```bash
./service.sh [ start | stop | restart ]
```

## Client 
By default, the client jar loads the GUI, if you wanna use the command line interface please add `cli` as argument. Otherwise, you can also double-click the jar file
```bash
java -jar client.jar [ cli ] 
```
### Compatibility notes for cli
The command line version of the game is optimized for unix-like terminals.

Our cli version of the game automatically resizes the terminal window for a better game experience.
Most terminals allow this by default, in case you have XTerm or iTerm:  
  * XTerm:  set the following resource to true: allowWindowOps
  * iTerm2: deselect the following: Preferences > Profiles > [profile] > Terminal > Disable session-initiated window resizing
 
 Otherwise please note that the minimum required size of the terminal to play the game is 160x50
## Documentation

### Javadoc 
Javadoc is available at this link: [http://santorini40.xyz/javadoc](http://santorini40.xyz/javadoc)  
Javadoc is also in this repo [here](/deliveries/final/javadoc) 
### UML diagrams 
UML diagrams are [here](/deliveries/final/uml) 
 
### Coverage report  
The final report of the coverage is [here](/deliveries/final/report)
